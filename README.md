## Discussion
This project was created over a two-year period as part of the capstone graduation requirement for my "Games, Interactive Media & Mobile" (GIMM) degree. I learned how to create a VR game from scratch with custom assets and pre-release SDKs during this time. All assets were created by myself with AutoDesk Maya (3D Modelling, UV Mapping, Animation), Adobe Photoshop & Substance Painter (Texturing), and Unity Shaders (Visual Effects). Code and gameplay were also created by myself in Unity3D and VSCode. Beta releases of Unity's XR-Interaction Toolkit enabled advanced interactions in VR without depending on a singular headset manufacturer (i.e. Oculus/Meta if using OpenVR at the time).
